# bookmark_manager

```
As a user in a hurry
So that I can quickly chose stored links
I want to view a list of links

As a user in a hurry
So that I save websites for future reference
I want to add the site's address and title to my bookmark manager

As a user in a hurry
So that I can find websites I recently bookmarked
I want to see links in chronological order

As a user in a hurry
So that I can group links together
I want to add tags to links in my bookmark manager

As a user in a hurry
So that I quickly find links grouped together
I want to filter links by a tag
```
